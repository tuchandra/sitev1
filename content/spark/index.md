# Spark + AI Summit 2019 Notes
I was fortunate enough to attend [Spark + AI Summit](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america) in San Francisco in April 2019. I took notes on the talks I attended in Markdown, and those notes made up the first pieces of content of this website. The source for all of these files can be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website in the "content/spark" directory.
