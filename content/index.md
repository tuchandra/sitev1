Hello, world! Welcome to my website. Everything is still very much under construction.

### [How I built this website](about_website.md)
*April 29, 2019*

You may have noticed that the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website has a tagline "... for people who *aren't* web developers." I am a data scientist and certainly fit that description, and so I'm going to talk about how I built this site using the tools I already know.

### [Spark + AI Summit 2019 Notes](spark/index.md)
*April 26, 2019*

I was fortunate enough to attend [Spark + AI Summit](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america) in San Francisco in April 2019. I took notes on the talks I attended in Markdown, and those notes made up the first pieces of content of this website. The source for all of these files can be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website in the "content/spark" directory.
