### Statistical nuance & the importance of uncertainty
###### October 20, 2019
In [my last post](silph.md), I re-analyzed shiny rates from The Silph Road and came to the conclusion that their proposed shiny rates were inconsistent with their own data. This post explores how that happened and what we can do to avoid it in the future.

### [Pokemon GO shiny rates: a Bayesian perspective](silph.html)
###### October 16, 2019
[The Silph Road](https://thesilphroad.com/) is the largest online and in-person network of Pokemon GO players and researchers. We investigate the question of how accurate their proposed shiny rates are by putting on our Bayesian hat, setting the "consensus" shiny rate as our prior, and using Silph field studies as observed data.

### [How I built this website](about_website.md)
###### April 29, 2019

You may have noticed that the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website has a tagline "... for people who *aren't* web developers."

### [Spark + AI Summit 2019 Notes](spark/index.md)
###### April 26, 2019
I was fortunate enough to attend [Spark + AI Summit](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america) in San Francisco in April 2019. I took notes on the talks I attended in Markdown, and those notes made up the first pieces of content of this website. The source for all of these files can be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website in the "content/spark" directory.
