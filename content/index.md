Hello, world! Welcome to my website. Everything is still very much under construction.

### [Paper: The Curse of Knowledge in Visual Data Communication](papers/curse_of_knowledge_xiong.md)
###### November 13, 2019
Summary of the paper by Cindy Xiong, Lisanne van Weeldan, and Steven Franconeri.

### [Why I'm interested in HCI](hci_directions.md)
###### October 28, 2019
A couple nights ago, I was at a bar talking to a grad student friend and we started having a conversation about HCI and research interests. This post captures some of my thoughts after reflecting for a couple of days.

### [Netflix and Polynote: first thoughts](polynote_netflix.md)
###### October 24, 2019
Netflix [announced yesterday](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447) that they are open-sourcing Polynote, a new notebook with features like Spark integration, as-you-type autocomplete, and more. At a glance, it seems to address almost every common complaint with notebooks. How much of that is too good to be true?

### [Statistical nuance & the importance of uncertainty](statistical_nuance.md)
###### October 20, 2019
In [my last post](silph.md), I re-analyzed shiny rates from The Silph Road and came to the conclusion that their proposed shiny rates were inconsistent with their own data. This post explores how that happened and what we can do to avoid it in the future.

### [Pokemon GO shiny rates: a Bayesian perspective](silph.html)
###### October 16, 2019
[The Silph Road](https://thesilphroad.com/) is the largest online and in-person network of Pokemon GO players and researchers. We investigate the question of how accurate their proposed shiny rates are by putting on our Bayesian hat, setting the "consensus" shiny rate as our prior, and using Silph field studies as observed data.

### [How I built this website](about_website.md)
###### April 29, 2019

You may have noticed that the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website has a tagline "... for people who *aren't* web developers." I am a data scientist and certainly fit that description, and so I'm going to talk about how I built this site using the tools I already know.

### [Spark + AI Summit 2019 Notes](spark/index.md)
###### April 26, 2019
I was fortunate enough to attend [Spark + AI Summit](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america) in San Francisco in April 2019. I took notes on the talks I attended in Markdown, and those notes made up the first pieces of content of this website. The source for all of these files can be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io) for this website in the "content/spark" directory.
