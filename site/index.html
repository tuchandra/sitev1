<p>I was fortunate enough to attend <a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america">Spark + AI Summit</a> in San Francisco in April 2019.

The source for all of these files can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io">Github repo</a> for this website in the &quot;content/spark&quot; directory.</p>
