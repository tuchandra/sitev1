        <h1>Tushar Chandra</h1>
<p>Hello, world! Welcome to my website. Everything is still very much under construction.</p>
<h2>Pages</h2>
<h3><a href="about_website.html">How I built this website</a></h3>
<h6>April 29, 2019</h6>
<p>You may have noticed that the <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io">Github repo</a> for this website has a tagline &quot;... for people who <em>aren't</em> web developers.&quot; I am a data scientist and certainly fit that description, and so I'm going to talk about how I built this site using the tools I already know.</p>
<h3><a href="spark/index.html">Spark + AI Summit 2019 Notes</a></h3>
<h6>April 26, 2019</h6>
<p>I was fortunate enough to attend <a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america">Spark + AI Summit</a> in San Francisco in April 2019. I took notes on the talks I attended in Markdown, and those notes made up the first pieces of content of this website. The source for all of these files can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io">Github repo</a> for this website in the &quot;content/spark&quot; directory.</p>
