        <h1>How I built this website</h1>
<p>You may notice that the <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io">Github repo</a> for this website has a tagline &quot;... for people who aren't web developers.&quot; I most certainly fit that description, and so I'm going to talk about my very simple website structure.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>My requirements were simple; all I <em>really</em> needed was a website that I could give to others that had basic things like my contact information, a web version of my resume, and some blog posts. I wanted to be able to write posts in Markdown and have them render as HTML. I wanted minimal styling to make the whole thing look nice. And, whatever tool I chose, I didn't want it to do more than necessary.</p>
<h2>Static site generators</h2>
<p>So, like any programmer, I started Googling for solutions. Common <strong>static site generators</strong> like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> are seriously impressive. They offer things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy installation via NPM</li>
<li>being able to pull data from multiple sources</li>
<li>hundreds of themes</li>
<li>powerful templating syntax</li>
<li>and much, much, more</li>
</ul>
<p>... but I don't need any of it. I didn't want to have to manage an NPM installation on the basic Chromebook from which I'm writing this. I don't even <em>know</em> React, and though my roommate loves it, I don't need it to build my simple website. And the idea of a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/adbu86/why_medium_is_no_longer_the_goto_platform_for/edfyuj4/?context=2">static site generator rendering pages entirely in JS</a> sounded like an oxymoron to me -- nothing on my site even needs JS.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not trying to rag on these technologies -- rather the opposite. I know React is super powerful, and that you can do almost anything in it, and that's exactly why I know I don't need it. I am a firm believer in not overengineering, and so throughout this whole progress I intentionally avoided solutions that would be overkill for this simple website.</p>
<h2>Finding puzzle pieces</h2>
<p>So I took another approach: what smaller pieces did I need to bring this together?</p>
<h3>sakura.css</h3>
<p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura">sakura.css</a>, which described itself as a &quot;minimal classless CSS theme.&quot; You just drop it in your folder and include it in your HTML files, and everything magically gets prettier. Perfect!</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I am using a <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io/blob/master/static/sakura.css">modified version</a> of sakura.css - I made the headings smaller, used a sans-serif font, and moved the footer a bit lower. The file being so simple allowed me to change this easily!</p>
