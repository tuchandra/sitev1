        <h1>How I built this website</h1>
<p>You may have noticed that the <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io">Github repo</a> for this website has a tagline &quot;... for people who <em>aren't</em> web developers.&quot; I am a data scientist and certainly fit that description, and so I'm going to talk about how I built this site using the tools I already know.</p>
<p>This website is hosted on Github Pages at tuchandra.github.io. I write posts in Markdown and render them via a 150-line Python script (<code>python makesite.py</code>). Since the content and the publishing tools all live in this repo, everything is managed by Git.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, right? It is.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>My requirements are simple, and can be boiled down to a website that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has basic, static content like my contact info, my resume, and some blog posts</li>
<li>lets me write blog posts in Markdown</li>
<li>uses minimal styling to make everything look nice</li>
<li>does not use JavaScript at all</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I don't need anything fancy. Notably, I also want my toolchain to have a similar degree of simplicity.</p>
<p>This post isn't about setting up a Github Pages site, or about hooking up your domain name to it. I followed some tutorial a month ago, and while I don't remember the exact one, <a href="https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58">any</a> <a href="https://hackernoon.com/use-custom-domain-with-github-pages-2-straightforward-steps-cf561eee244f">of</a> <a href="https://medium.com/employbl/launch-a-website-with-a-custom-url-using-github-pages-and-google-domains-3dd8d90cc33b">these</a> should probably work.</p>
<h2>Static site generators</h2>
<p>Like any programmer, I started by Googling for solutions that did what I wanted. The term &quot;static site generator&quot; captured what I wanted, and I came across common ones like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. These were seriously impressive, offering things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy installation via NPM</li>
<li>joining data sources using GraphQL</li>
<li>hundreds of themes</li>
<li>powerful templating syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>... and I didn't need any of it.</p>
<p>I don't want to manage an NPM installation on the Chromebook from which I'm writing this. I don't even <em>know</em> React, and though my roommate loves it, I am certain that I don't need to learn it just to build this simple website. And the idea of a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/adbu86/why_medium_is_no_longer_the_goto_platform_for/edfyuj4/?context=2">static site generator rendering pages entirely in JavaScript</a> still sounds like an oxymoron to me -- again, nothing on my site needs JS.</p>
<p>Please do note that I'm not trying to hate on these technologies -- rather the opposite. I know that React is incredibly powerful, and that much of the modern web is built in it, and that it can do almost anything. These are exactly the reasons why I <em>don't</em> want it. Using a powerful SSG would introduce unnecessary complexity to this process, and I am a firm believer in not overengineering. My requirements are minimal and well-defined, so there's no reason my toolchain can't be.</p>
<h2>Another approach: makesite.py</h2>
<p>After static site generators seemed to be overkill, I started searching for more basic solutions. One stuck out: makesite.py (<a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">Github link</a>), which described itself as a &quot;simple, lightweight, and magic-free static site/blog generator for Python coders.&quot; I know Python well, and this seemed easy enough to understand. Great!</p>
<p>This turned out to be awesome: write in Markdown, run the script, have it all render as HTML. It sounded dead simple, and yet I still didn't need everything that this offered me. But I figured that this was as simple as I was going to find online, so I dove into the code and started stripping things down myself. Let's walk through some of the changes that I made:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed everything to do with RSS feeds, three custom layouts, and date parsing</li>
<li>removed optional config from a <code>params.json</code> file, since I can just specify parameters in code</li>
<li>added code to get the title of a Markdown file as the first top-level heading, since otherwise you had to specify it with a redundant <code>&lt;!-- title: Name of Post --&gt;</code> comment</li>
<li>added code to replace links to Markdown pages with links to their generated HTML pages, since otherwise you get broken links</li>
<li>removed the try/except logic surrounding the optional commonmark dependency, since I definitely need it</li>
</ul>
<p>I also used some newer features of Python that I encourage everyone to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">Pathlib</a>, because it's great to be able to distinguish between strings and paths</li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">type hints</a> in my function signatures and a <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> to catch bugs ahead of time</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/">Poetry</a> for environment management, since I like it better than basic virtualenvs or pipenv, and I don't have conda on my Chromebook</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I cleaned up the main function <code>make_pages</code> to be considerably simpler. I wanted to throw everything into a <code>content/</code> directory and have my generated site retain that structure, so I wrote a straightforward recursion to take care of it for me.</p>
<h3>sakura.css - minimal, classless CSS</h3>
<p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura">sakura.css</a>, which described itself as a &quot;minimal classless CSS theme.&quot; In theory, you drop it in your folder, include it in your HTML files, and everything magically gets prettier. In practice, that's exactly what happened; I added the file to my <code>static</code> folder and updated the template, and that was it.</p>
<p>My site uses a slightly modified version of this file -- I used a sans-serif font, made the headings smaller, and changed some of the colors (still a work in progress). CSS is one of the things that I appreciate and respect, but, as a data scientist, also dread working with. Having a single, easy to modify file made applying a theme to my site painless.</p>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>The entire <code>makesite.py</code> script is just over 150 lines of code, including comments and whitespace, and it handles my use case flawlessly. See the script <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io/blob/master/makesite.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can write my blog posts in Markdown -- see the <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io/blob/master/content/about_website.md">source of this page</a> for an example -- and then type <code>poetry run python makesite.py</code> to generate the <code>site/</code> directory. Note that because Github Pages hosts the entire repo, the rendered website actually lives at tusharc.dev/site; to get around this, <a href="https://github.com/tuchandra/tuchandra.github.io/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> in my home directory just redirects to that page.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This post describes how I wrote my own minimal website by using an equally minimal set of tools. While I'm still working on adding content to my website, it feels great knowing that I can write in Markdown, run a Python script, and have everything <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>For the Python programmer out there who has no experience with the web, I promise that it's not all NPM hell and React apps -- you can build your own nice-looking site with the tools you already know!</p>
